# What is my IP?

This is a tool to call an external service to get your public IP address and then print it out.

## Local development

I recommend using setuptools and virtualenv:

`virtualenv venv`

And then install it for development:

`pip install --editable .`

## Installation

This uses setuptools, so it can be installed using pip:

`pip install .`
